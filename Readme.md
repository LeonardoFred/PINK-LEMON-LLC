### About us

Hi Leonardo

Can we discuss on Skype?

I'll explain shortly why we need to talk about it.

As a freelancer, I am required to follow their policies.

They will immediately disable my account if I make a mistake while conversing with a client.

Our contract will be terminated at that point by the freelancing platform. It will have an unanticipated impact on the development of our project.

So, to avoid this problem, I believe we should communicate over another platform, such as Skype.


Hi Mohamed,
I prefer to use google meet. 
My email is leonardo.fredduzzi@gmail.com and we talk on that platform.

If you agree, please join *https://join.skype.com/invite/xo5EPn7knKFx* or search **live:.cid.55ed0bb104b24bb**

Thank you.
